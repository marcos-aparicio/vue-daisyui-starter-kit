# Laravel + VueJS + DaisyUI Starter Kit

## Introduction

This is basically a port of the official VueJS starter kit while trying to simplify its components and make it look pretty much the same but using DaisyUI.

Unlike the official VueJS starter kit, this kit uses [TailwindCSS4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/),  . Besides [DaisyUI5](https://daisyui.com/docs/intro/) , [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),  [InertiaJS2](https://inertiajs.com/)  and their dependencies I also used [@heroicons/vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heroicons/vue) for the icons.

I was heavily inspired on both [the official vuejs starter kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit) and [this unstyled blade starter kit](https://github.com/javdome/unstyled-blade-starter-kit). So huge thanks to the Laravel team and javdome!
